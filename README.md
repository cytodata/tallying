# tallying

This repo is used to maintain an R Markdown Notebook to tally votes for deciding the next CytoData venue. 

- conduct the poll via Google Forms (contact the [Event Officer](http://society.cytodata.org/#leadership) for details)
- export into a Google Spreadsheet
- remove duplicates
- edit the institution column names to abbreviate appropriately (here, `fimm_brc, dkfz, janssen, kcl, i3s`)
- cleanup the entries under the `institution` column to make them consistent
- download as a CSV 
- edit the notebook and run!
